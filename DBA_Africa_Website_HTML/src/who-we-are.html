                  <p>DBA Africa is the first not-for profit sports management company in the world. By linking the professional athletes with our work in the youth academies and grass roots sport, we invest in the long term future of sport in Africa.</p>
                  <p>Our grassroots sport projects do so much more than keep children active – we teach important health lessons, we strengthen communities, we nurture future leaders, we help girls aspire to better lives.</p>
                  <p>Our youth academies fill a void that will help African nations catch up to Tier 1 sporting nations.  With so much natural talent, we know investment will yield results.</p>

                  <p>DBA Africa acts as the marketing representative for each athlete we manage. We enhance our elite athletes’ earnings through sponsorship deals, endorsements and placements as well as finding new and innovative ways to build our athletes’ brands. Our knowledge of national and international brands as well as experience in the field means that we offer athletes a wide range of opportunity.</p>

                  <p>At DBA Africa we assist our athletes in all areas of their sporting life, including providing them with sports kit, assisting with negotiating new contracts, aiding with long term career planning, facilitating travel and visas to races and matches, and providing enhanced coaching and strength and conditioning sessions that they would otherwise not receive through their national programmes.  Our local presence means we can attend training and get to know our athletes’ struggles. We build our athlete relationship from the ground up.</p>

                  <p>We nurture new and upcoming talent through our youth academies.  We enable more athletes to get the opportunity to discover their sport and to access better coaches, facilities and mentorship. Our grassroots charity events allow children from very poor backgrounds to discover the joy of sport. Our scholarship programme to our youth academies will provide a number of places in each youth academy fully free of charge, allowing children from disadvantaged backgrounds to join our academies. We hope to expand the scholarship programme significantly over the years.</p>
