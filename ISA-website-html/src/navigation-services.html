                                 <p>Depending on your personal circumstances you may be required to complete a self-assessment tax return. We can help you work out whether you need to complete one in
                                    the first place. We will also take away some of the stress by completing the return for you. Provided we have the information in time we will ensure it is completed
                                    before the filing deadline (31 January after the end of the tax year). We will also ensure that the return is completed correctly reducing the risk of penalties
                                    arising from investigations by HM Revenue and Customs.</p>
                                 <p>We will calculate the tax that is due and advise you of the tax payments that need to be made. As part of the process, we will also offer advice on how to minimise
                                    your tax liability.</p>

                                 <p>HMRC tax investigations are very stressful even if they are handled well. They can arise any year you file a self-assessment tax return. Even for the most trivial
                                    matter it can still be time consuming and costly in terms of the fees to pay, and whether or not there is any additional tax to pay as a result of the enquiry. This
                                    service provides you with protection from the professional fees that will arise, ensuring we can challenge the HMRC’s assertions and assumptions and you get a fair

                                 <p>We will always look at ways to reduce your tax liability under self-assessment when we prepare your returns. Events or transactions do occur outside of this annual
                                    cycle. We can ensure that they are dealt with in the most tax efficient way. Better still if you are thinking of buying or selling a business, property or some
                                    other asset, let us know in advance of the transaction as we can make sure you minimise any tax liability that will arise. The rules and available reliefs for
                                    Capital Gains Tax (CGT) are complex and should be reviewed in advance of the transaction. If you sell a property now you have to complete a CGT schedule and pay the
                                    tax due within 30 days of completion. Planning ahead is always advisable, we can help you consider your potential Inheritance Tax (IHT) liability. There may be
                                    steps you can take to reduce any potential liability.</p>

                                 <p>Depending on your personal circumstances you may be required to complete a self-assessment tax return. We can help you work out whether you need to complete one in
                                    the first place. We will also take away some of the stress by completing the return for you. Provided we have the information in time we will ensure it is completed
                                    before the filing deadline (31 January after the end of the tax year). We will also ensure that the return is completed correctly reducing the risk of penalties
                                    arising from investigations by HM Revenue and Customs.</p>
                                 <p>We will calculate the tax that is due and advise you of the tax payments that need to be made. As part of the process, we will also offer advice on how to minimise
                                    your tax liability.</p>

                                 <p>HMRC tax investigations are very stressful even if they are handled well. They can arise any year you file a self-assessment tax return. Even for the most trivial
                                    matter it can still be time consuming and costly in terms of the fees to pay, and whether or not there is any additional tax to pay as a result of the enquiry. This
                                    service provides you with protection from the professional fees that will arise, ensuring we can challenge the HMRC’s assertions and assumptions and you get a fair
                                    hearing.</p>

                                 <p>We will always look at ways to reduce your tax liability under self-assessment when we prepare your returns. Events or transactions do occur outside of this annual
                                    cycle. We can ensure that they are dealt with in the most tax efficient way. Better still if you are thinking of buying or selling a business, property or some
                                    other asset, let us know in advance of the transaction as we can make sure you minimise any tax liability that will arise. The rules and available reliefs for
                                    Capital Gains Tax (CGT) are complex and should be reviewed in advance of the transaction. If you sell a property now you have to complete a CGT schedule and pay the
                                    tax due within 30 days of completion. Planning ahead is always advisable, we can help you consider your potential Inheritance Tax (IHT) liability. There may be
                                    steps you can take to reduce any potential liability.</p>
